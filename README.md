# bbobby-game

This repository contains some experimental game code and a small, browser-based "School Games" site located in the `site/` folder.

Live site URL (after enabling GitHub Pages from the `main` branch root):

- Expected URL: `https://252208-design.github.io/bbobby-game/`

How to publish with GitHub Pages:

1. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository on GitHub: Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)` → Save.
3. Wait a minute and open the expected URL above.

Files for the simple site live under `site/`. Open `site/index.html` locally to try the games, or publish the repository with Pages for a public URL.

Files added:

- `site/index.html` — landing page for mini-games.
- `site/styles.css` — simple stylesheet for the site.
- `site/games/tictactoe.html` — Tic‑Tac‑Toe.
- `site/games/rps.html` — Rock‑Paper‑Scissors.
- `site/games/reaction.html` — Reaction time tester.

Enjoy! If you want, I can deploy this to GitHub Pages for you and verify the live URL.
```

Direct site URL (points at the `site/` folder we added):

- `https://252208-design.github.io/bbobby-game/site/index.html`

Note: I pushed the changes to your fork during the publish step. The Pages site for the repository reports the canonical Pages URL is `https://252208-design.github.io/bbobby-game/`. If you want the new `site/` pages to be served from the repository root URL, we can either:

- move the `site/` contents to the repository root (will overwrite the root `index.html`), or
- change the Pages source to serve from the `/site` folder in repository settings (requires repository admin or GH API permissions).

Tell me which option you prefer and I will proceed.
